## Project Name: _[Insert project name]_

### Date: _[Insert date]_

## 1. **Task/Problem Description**

``text
I need to create an program using pygame, that allows the player to move a character horizontally to collect items.
``

---

## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**

```python
import pygame
pygame.init()

screen_width = 1200
screen_height = 800

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width,screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Game")

running = True 
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        screen.fill((235, 192, 230))
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    
    
screen.fill((100, 0, 0))
pygame.display.update()
```

My initial approch to this project is to create an basic pygame window and a game loop. I havenâ€™t yet added any gameplay mechanics.

## 3. **Interaction with ChatGPT**

### Questions/Requests to ChatGPT

```text
How do I add a player that moves left and right on the screen?
```

---

## 4. **ChatGPT's Suggestions/Code Changes**

```python
import pygame

pygame.init()

screen_width = 1200
screen_height = 800
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Game")

# Player setup
player_width = 50
player_height = 50
player_x = screen_width // 2
player_y = screen_height - player_height - 10
player_speed = 5

running = True 
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Player movement
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT] and player_x > 0:
        player_x -= player_speed
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT] and player_x < screen_width - player_width:
        player_x += player_speed

    # Background color
    screen.fill((235, 192, 230))

    # Draw player
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 0, 255), (player_x, player_y, player_width, player_height))

    pygame.display.update()

pygame.quit()
    pass
```

- What was ChatGPT's solution or suggestion?
- How did it differ from your original approach?

## 5. **Reflection on Changes**

ChatGPT was helpful in setting up movement. The game loop now allows for continuous movement, and the player can move around the character. I now know how to use basic user input and move a player object around in pygame. 

---

## 6. **Testing and Results**

I ran the updated code, and the player character moves left and right. However, it's still missing music notes and a scoring system.

---

## 7. **What Did You Learn?**

I learned how to use basic user input and move a player object around in pygame. I also have an little understanding on game loops in pygame. I am more confident in the basics, however, I need more practice with adding and handling multiple game objects.
